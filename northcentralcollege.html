				<p>As Assistant Director of the Fine and Performing Arts at North Central College, a large part of my job was marketing and audience development for our music, theatre and fine arts programming. I collaborated with the marketing department to create and choreograph multichannel marketing campaigns that resulted in several sold out shows and ticket sales that surpassed projections each season. I designed and implemented a digital marketing strategy where there was none before, including Facebook and geolocation ads, which contributed to an increase in new ticket buyers and year-over-year increase of 16% in ticket sales.  </p>

						<h1>Email</h1>
						<p>I created new email templates that better reflected the brand and encouraged growing click though rates. I used data from previous emails, google analytics and industry competitors as well as A/B testing to help inform email content and schedule, resulting in open rates and click through rates that surpassed industry standards.
