				<p>Distinct Bath & Body in Chicago specializes in handcrafted bath and body products made with natural ingredients that are often locally sourced. This small but mighty business is run by my uncle and his family and their products are truly made with love and a low carbon footprint, as well as being utterly amazing for your skin. They primarily sell their products through their store and website, with a few retailers around Chicago and Los Angeles. 
				<br><br>
				My uncle was looking to grow his business so he hired me to manage the website and cultivate customers via social media and email. I also helped further define the brand and it's voice as well as created a customer persona based on data for smarter, more targeted marketing. After establishing a good baseline for what worked with the marketing, I was able to contribute to a $58,000 increase in sales as well as an increase in social followers and email subscribers.

						<h1>Email</h1>
						<p> I redesigned the email templates to be more on-brand and encourage higher click-through rates, and created content that not only promoted products but also helped customers feel more connected with the business and staff. I also added value to the emails with exclusive deals. This contributed to an increase in open rates, a decrease in unsubscribes, and a 20% increase in website traffic from emails. I was able to grow the email list 150% over 18 months by improving the quality of content, promoting email sign-up on social media with little to no ad budget, adding an email sign-up pop-up to the website, and offering sign-up incentives in-store and at various events.</p>

						<h1>Website</h1>
						<p> I switched their website from Weebly to Shopify and designed a more modern and brand focused site. Shopify gave the site a better flow for e-commerce focused business, had better integration with email and social, and gave the owner better tools to manage the sales & shipping process. All of this led to decreased bounces, 42% increase in sessions and a conversion rate increase from 1.3% to 2.5%.
